Module chat for Goldsmiths Students

This is my Year 2 CP2 project.  It provides a per-module, instant messaging chat capability for Goldsmiths student.

It integrates the learn.gold (Moodle) so that students can access chats for the modules they are registered on.

There are two node.js apps:

## web_scraper
Scrapes modules and participants from learn.gold.

## web_app
The chat app itself.
